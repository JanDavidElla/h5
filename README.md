 ## Question 1. Define the following unit, integration, regression tests and when you would use each?
 - Integration test: An integration test is a type of software test that verifies that different working components work together. You would use this type of test usually after unit testing, when you want to combine components together to fix any logic errors from the interactions between the modules or to fix incorrect API calls/responses.

 - Regression test: An regression test is a type of software test that checks whether or not new code changes broke any pre-existing code, or if it shows anything unexpected. This could come from any underlying issues not detected earlier. You would use this type of test after any updates in the code, like bug fixes, or before releasing new software to make sure everything works smoothly and as expected. 

 ## Question 2. Briefly explain pytest discovery (file/function naming) and what a fixture is.
 - Pytest discovery basically finds and runs tests based on how its named. It would have to start with "test_" This helps pytest find which functions to run. A fixture basically is a function that feeds information to the program prior to running the test. For example, it could provide a sample parameter or instance.
